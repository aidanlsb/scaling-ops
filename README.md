# Scaling Operations Modeling

* Could allocate depreciation to fleet, etc.
* Then find depreciation per shift / per lift
  * Help get at cost per lift

* Revenue = Lifts * $/Lift
  * Lifts = lifts/shift * shifts
    * Shifts = days worked * shifts_per_day
    * lifts/shift = ?
  * $/Lift = $/volume * volume/lift
    * $/volume = ?
    * volume/lift = fixed

* Cost to serve = lifts * cost/lift
  * Lifts = lifts/shift * shifts
    * Shifts = days worked * shifts_per_day
    * lifts/shift = ?
  * cost/lift = driver_labor/lift + other_labor/lift + disposal/lift + fuel/lift + maintenance/lift + depreciation/lift
    *
