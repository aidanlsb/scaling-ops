# Appendix: Key Assumptions
 
* All financial data presented in balance sheet and income statement is attributable to the collection unit and not the landfill unit of Waste Wizard
* Waste pickup is truly "on demand," i.e. every lift is a full bin's worth of waste (Waste Wizard is not able to "lift" a partially full bin and get paid as if it were full)
* The "other operating costs" on the P&L are directly attributable to collection activities and scale with the number of trucks in the fleet (e.g. depot operations)
* New trucks cost $250K, have a useful life of 10 years and a salvage value of $25K
