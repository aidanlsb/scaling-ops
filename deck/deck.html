* If they don't build out their landfill network too, disposal costs may raise as they need to use third-party providers

# Appendix: Key Assumptions
 
* The financial data presented are understood to encompass both the collections units and the landfill unit. I assume that 75% of Waste Wizard's operating revenue are attributable to the collections unit (in line with large public player in the space)
* Waste pickup is truly "on demand," i.e. every lift is a full bin's worth of waste (Waste Wizard is not able to "lift" a partially full bin and get paid as if it were full)
* If a truck is deployed, it is deployed for a full shift
* New trucks cost $150K, have a useful life of 5 years and a salvage value of $25K
* Net fixed assets (fleet and some small fraction of PPE attributable to depots) scale by a factor proportional to fleet size (e.g. a 10% increase in fleet size leads to a 10% inrease in net fleet asset value, and a small increase in PPE)
